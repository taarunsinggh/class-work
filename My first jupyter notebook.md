#### Let's look at bold and italics
In this line of text *this item will be in italics* while this will not. By the same token _this will be_ but this won't. In this line of text **this item will be bold** while this will not. By the same token __this will be but__ this won't. This would be **bold and *italics* text**.

# My Temperature Conversion Script
In this exercise, I want to enter a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and have the code calculate degrees in Celsius.


```python
f = float(input("Enter the temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit? "))
c = (f-32)*5/9
c
print()
print("The temperature " + str(f) + " degrees Fahrenheit is " + str(round((c),2)) + " degrees Celsius.")
```

    Enter the temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit? 90
    
    The temperature 90.0 degrees Fahrenheit is 32.22 degrees Celsius.
    


```python

```
